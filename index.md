My name is Yu (Edward) Cheng. I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in Department of Statistics and Finance, the University of Science and Technology of China(USTC). I am advised by <strong><a href="https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/english/profile.php?id=352" target="_blank">Dr. Canhong Wen</a></strong> in USTC and <strong><a href="https://science.oregonstate.edu/directory/yuan-jiang" target="_blank">Dr. Yuan Jiang</a></strong> in Oregon State University.

My research interests lie in Biostatistics. During my spare time, I enjoy running, reading, playing chess.
