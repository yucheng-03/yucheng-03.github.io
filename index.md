Hi! I am Yu (Edward) Cheng, a first year master student in the Department of Statistics, Oregon State University.

Before joining OSU, I got my Bachelor's degree of science in Statistics in 2025 from the Department of Statistics and Finance at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and was grateful to be supervised by <strong><a href="https://science.oregonstate.edu/directory/yuan-jiang" target="_blank">Dr. Yuan Jiang</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/english/profile.php?id=352" target="_blank">Dr. Canhong Wen</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
A small step for science, a giant leap for our understanding of the world. I combine statistical and machine learning methods to uncover new perspectives on complex problems. My current research focuses on the challenges of Time-Varying network estimation in high-dimensional situations. Beyond this, I maintain a strong interest in broader topics such as reinforcement learning and multi-armed bandits.
