<p>
My name is Yu (Edward) Cheng, and I'm currently a fourth - year undergraduate student in the Department of Statistics and Finance at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

I'm incredibly fortunate to be under the guidance of two outstanding advisors. At USTC, I work closely with <strong><a href="https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/english/profile.php?id=352" target="_blank">Dr. Canhong Wen</a></strong>. Her profound knowledge and unwavering dedication in the field have provided me with invaluable insights and support throughout my academic journey.

In addition, I'm also advised by <strong><a href="https://science.oregonstate.edu/directory/yuan-jiang" target="_blank">Dr. Yuan Jiang</a></strong> from Oregon State University. His international perspective and innovative research methods have broadened my horizons and inspired me to explore new frontiers in my studies. 

This dual - mentoring experience has not only enriched my academic growth but also allowed me to blend the best of both worlds in the pursuit of knowledge.

My research interests lie in Biostatistics.
