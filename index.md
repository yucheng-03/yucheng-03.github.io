Hi! I am Yu (Edward) Cheng, a first-year Master's student in the Department of Statistics at Oregon State University.

Prior to joining OSU, I received my B.S. in Statistics in 2025 from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be advised by <strong><a href="https://science.oregonstate.edu/directory/yuan-jiang" target="_blank">Dr. Yuan Jiang</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/english/profile.php?id=352" target="_blank">Dr. Canhong Wen</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
A small step for science, a giant leap for our understanding of the world. My current research focuses on the challenges of Time-Varying network estimation especially in high-dimensional situations. Beyond this, I maintain a strong interest in broader topics such as reinforcement learning and multi-armed bandits.

I enjoy connecting with people from diverse backgrounds, as it offers fresh perspectives on the world. I would love to hear your story or get recommendations for your favorite books. Please feel free to reach out to discuss my research, explore potential collaborations and share your stories.
