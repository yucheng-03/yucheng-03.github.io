Apart from those statistical fields, I have also developed a great deal of interest in the following subjects over the years.

## Sports
I enjoy almost all kinds of sports, especially running and playing Chinese chess. Running brings me great peace in my inner world and helps me better understand my own feelings. I also enjoy the feeling of calmly thinking about the chess situation when playing Chinese chess, as well as the honor and excitement brought by the game.

## Reading
Reading provides me with a way to explore the world from others' perspectives. The fascinating life experiences of other people really appeal to me, and I've gained a great deal from some of the books I've read. They offer me a brand - new perspective on my own life.

I'd like to share some books below that I believe are worth reading：

</ul>



## History

As Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty, Li Shimin, once said, “With history as a mirror, one can understand the rise and fall of a state” (以史为镜，可以知兴替). I have a deep - seated fondness for historical documentaries, as well as documentary books and talks especially on these topics:

  <li><em style="font-weight: bold;">The Era of Japan's Economic Bubble: A Historical Exploration</em></li>
  
</ul>

## Psychology

I'm deeply fascinated by psychology, particularly the psychoanalysis theories similar to Adler's. Delving into this field offers me a special lens through which I can decipher the logic behind people's diverse behaviors, regardless of their backgrounds.

## Nature

Staying close to nature makes me feel energetic and relaxed. I really appreciate all kinds of natural beauty in the natural world.

## Storytelling

Stories can be presented in various forms, such as animations, TV dramas, movies, and more. When I was a kid, I was an absolute fan of the character Xiaofeng Ouyang from the animation "Marble Legends". He was an all - around wise and capable character, characterized by his integrity, courage, leadership, and kindness.
As I grew older, my interests expanded to a wide range of stories. I'm really into TV dramas like "Empresses in the Palace", "Nirvana in Fire", "The Journey of Flower", "Latent" and "Drawing Sword". These shows have rich plots, well - developed characters, and profound themes that always draw me in.
In addition to TV dramas, I also enjoy watching movies. "Dune" takes me to a magnificent and mysterious universe; the "Avengers" series offers thrilling battles and a complex hero universe; and "The Shawshank Redemption" touches my heart deeply with its story of hope and perseverance.

## Others
Beyond the aforementioned interests, I've also developed a profound admiration for the Shanghai Rainbow Singers.Additionally, I'm deeply smitten with Chinese calligraphy, especially the Kai and Xing scripts, as they not only offer a feast for the eyes with their distinct aesthetics but also bring me a profound sense of fulfillment during the writing process.
